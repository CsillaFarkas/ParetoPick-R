new buffer calc, unclear where to put or how to calculate, needs area and geometry

subset relda 1207 with only those in another reactive value, maybe all or never or smaller buffer??

#buffer needed? those with area <=0.01% of total cm
  hru_sel$area = st_area(hru_sel)
  cm_tot = sum(hru_sel$area)
  hru_sel$area_share = (hru_sel$area/cm_tot)*100
  
  
  boundaries <- st_cast(hru_sel$geometry, "MULTILINESTRING")
  hru_sel$perimeter = st_length(boundaries)
  hru_sel$perimeter = rm_units(hru_sel$perimeter);hru_sel$area = rm_units(hru_sel$area_share);hru_sel$area_share = rm_units(hru_sel$area_share)
  
  hru_sel = hru_sel %>% mutate(needs_buff = case_when(perimeter/sqrt(area) > 4.5 & area_share <= 0.05 ~ "yes",
                                                      area_share <= 0.01 ~ "yes",
                                                      TRUE ~ "no"))
